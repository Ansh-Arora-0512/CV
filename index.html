                <span class="skill">Problem Solving</span>
                <p>I particularly enjoy maths and computer science because challenging problems in both enable me to think creatively and reach rewarding solutions.</p>

            <div class="skill">
                <span class="skill">Presenting</span>
                <p>I have improved my public speaking skills over the past few years, taking on presentations on topics interesting to me such as Neural Networks, Chaos Theory, and a maze-solving robot I built.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="skill">
                <span class="skill">Planning & Time Management</span>
                <p>Time management is a skill I've come to acquire after organising projects alongside schoolwork, taking the time necessary to make general plans and then set deadlines for myself and stick to them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="skill">
                <span class="skill">Teamwork</span>
                <p>I work well in teams and can adapt to any group, as I have had to do often in school and projects. I have found that in a team a complex task can be split up into the specialities of different teammates.</p>

                    <p>Founded a maths society in my school with the help of the head of the maths department to practice enrichment questions with other students and help set up competitions. So far we have set up and enrolled teams for the Ritangle competition.</p>

                    <span class="project">Fire Detecting UAV</span>
                    <span class="duration">May 2024 - Present</span>
                </div>
                <p>Worked in a team of 4 to build a UAV which could fly over forests and similar terrain to spot fires and collect data on where they tend to start and spread. Having seen the impact of drought and heat waves on our region, 3 friends and I wanted to see how our skills could contribute towards such problems. I was in charge of programming, where I interfaced with Ardupilot to steer and stabilise the drone, wrote a hybrid algorithm including a Convolutional Neural Network to spot fires in frames of footage taken from underneath the drone, and stored and analysed records of where fires were spotted. The project is still in progress, with a second prototype being developed, and we have sent a proposal to the regional Forest Defense Group, hoping for a licence to better test our drone.</p>

                    <span class="duration">November 2023 - April 2024</span>
                </div>
                <p>For the Extended Project Qualification Artefact, I built a small robot that could reach the centre of a 16x16 unit maze with no information on the maze to begin with. This was my first big robotics project, and in the process of working on it I picked up many skills such as the persistence needed to scrap and rebuild several models and constantly recalibrate parts, as well as low-level programming with C++. I wrote an accompanying 5500+ words dissertation discussing the floodfill algorithm used to navigate the mouse, the construction process using Arduino, and the possible uses of such a device, for example in inventory management in a warehouse. The artefact earned full marks.</p>

                    <span class="duration">January 2023 - June 2023</span>
                </div>
                <p>A personal project made up of a compiler, debugger and text editor for my own esoteric programming language which was inspired by and is a superset of Urban Müller's BF. This was one of my earlier projects made in python using Tkinter, and it helped me better understand concepts such as object oriented programming and asynchronous programming. I enjoyed this project because it tested my creativity in the process of designing the commands of the language I made to fuse BF with ideas from modern languages such as functional programming, and I was able to write interesting programs in the language I had made after I was finished.</p>
